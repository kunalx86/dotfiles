# These are my dotfiles for my desktop configuration.

## Configuration is included for the following software
* i3-gaps
* Alacritty-ligatures (aur) - Note I have set the theme OneDark using alacritty-themes (npx alacritty-themes)
* Rofi - Once again I am using the Adv-Dark.rasi theme from rofi-theme-selector
* nvim - Plug is necessary to install plugins
* polybar - There is an issue with brightness. Permission has to be changed after every boot for /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness
* picom
* zshrc

** Do note you will need a patched font for things to work correctly. I have used FiraCode Nerd Font and JetbrainsMono Font in my configs.
